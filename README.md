Aggregate Functions in C

Technologies Utilized: Oracle NetBeans IDE 8.2, C

Description: This is a simple project written in C language that demonstrates how we can implement mathematical functions for making aggregate operations using a user-defined static data structure at runtime such as an array.

List of aggregate operations implemented as functions:
- arrayInit {initialize an array}
- getAvg {calculate the average of all numbers in array}
- getCountSum {count and sum numbers in array}
- getEven {return even number(s) from array}
- getMax {get max number from array}
- getMin {get min number from array}
- getOdd {return odd number(s) from array}
- getPct {calculate the percentage of all numbers in array based on parameter}
